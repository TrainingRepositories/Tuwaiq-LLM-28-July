I said: Can you check please as I refer to the many tables available!!  She screams no, I don't have this available for 4 people with her 4 fingers and you 2!!  I said we are 3 brother on the way!!  She said and still she screamed: You can have it!  I said why are you angry with us?  She looks at me from top to bottom and turns and leaves us without saying a word!!\\n\\n   Oh my God, I couldn't yell at her because I wouldn't get down to that level with her!!  But in fact this ruined all my stay and we are all still not getting past it!!  Since we didn't do anything, we respectfully asked for another table!\\n\\nDo you think she came back and said sorry i didn\\u2019t mean it ! No !! She keep give me that look the whole time in the breakfast !! \\n\\nI have never go back to the breakfast its really embarrassed .\\n\\nThats hotel with every thing good how they let staff like her to work there i didn\\u2019t came to have this angry face first things in the morning !!\\n\\nOther than that, the hotel is very beautiful and the location is excellent\",\n          \"We had a one night stay prior to taking the Eurostar to London. We arrived around 3 15pm and had to wait in line nearly 40 minutes. When we did get to the front desk, we were told that our room was not ready which was surprising since it was now 4pm. We went out for a snack and we\\u2019re called to say our room was ready. Our room was large and very nice with a reasonable price ( for Paris) and the location is good.

I said: Can you check please as I refer to the many tables available!!  She screams no, I don't have this available for 4 people with her 4 fingers and you 2!!  I said we are 3 brother on the way!!  She said and still she screamed: You can have it!  I said why are you angry with us?  She looks at me from top to bottom and turns and leaves us without saying a word!!\\n\\n   Oh my God, I couldn't yell at her because I wouldn't get down to that level with her!!  But in fact this ruined all my stay and we are all still not getting past it!!  Since we didn't do anything, we respectfully asked for another table!\\n\\nDo you think she came back and said sorry i didn\\u2019t mean it ! No !! She keep give me that look the whole time in the breakfast !! \\n\\nI have never go back to the breakfast its really embarrassed .\\n\\nThats hotel with every thing good how they let staff like her to work there i didn\\u2019t came to have this angry face first things in the morning !!\\n\\nOther than that, the hotel is very beautiful and the location is excellent\",\n          \"We had a one night stay prior to taking the Eurostar to London.

We went out for a snack and we\\u2019re called to say our room was ready. Our room was large and very nice with a reasonable price ( for Paris) and the location is good.

We appreciated that as we hate the polyester bedding so many hotels use. The room was nicely cool with a quiet indiscrete air conditioner. We loved the bathroom, and the shower is a dream, great pressure, a huge rainshower head and a large shower stall. There were two nice closets, and good lighting.\\nThe spa in the basement is a real treat, very magical and beautiful, and great to swim or soak, with a fantastic overhead jet to massage neck or back. \\nBest of all, the location is perfect, two blocks to the Seine, the Louvre is right across the river, and a short couple of blocks to the heart of Saint Germain.
